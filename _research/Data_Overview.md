| device_exposure.parquet | Records medical devices used by patients (e.g., pacemakers, insulin pumps). |
| specimen.parquet   | Stores laboratory specimen details.                                         |

## 4. Healthcare Utilization (Visits, Costs, Providers)

| File Name         | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| visit_occurrence.parquet | Logs hospital visits, outpatient visits, and other patient encounters. |
| provider.parquet   | Information on healthcare providers.                                       |
| care_site.parquet  | Details of hospitals, clinics, or healthcare facilities.                   |
| cost.parquet       | Contains cost-related information (important for health economics analysis). |
| payer_plan_period.parquet | Maps patients to insurance plans and coverage periods.               |

## 5. Lab Tests & Measurements

| File Name         | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| measurement.parquet | Contains structured lab test results (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol).  |
| note.parquet       | Free-text clinical notes (useful for NLP-based insights).                  |
| note_nlp.parquet   | Extracted structured concepts from free-text clinical notes using NLP.     |

## Reasoning for Choosing These Files

- Relevance to PLP Modeling: These files provide data on patient demographics, medical history, medication usage, healthcare encounters, and outcomesâ€”all critical for training and validating patient-level prediction models.
- Alignment with OMOP CDM: The selected tables represent a subset of the full OMOP CDM, covering the most important categories needed for predictive modeling.
- Focus on Structured Data with Some NLP: The inclusion of `note.parquet` and `note_nlp.parquet` suggests that there is some interest in leveraging unstructured clinical text data, but the focus remains on structured data (e.g., diagnoses, procedures, drugs).
